To build docs from source code first run
```
sphinx-apidoc -o ./source ../src/pymdstresslab 
```

from the doc folder. This shall generate files for all the docsctrings and classes etc.

Following this, include the rst files generated in index.rst (by adding their name to the index file without the suffixt `.rst`)

Finally run `make html`.

You can now open the Documentation as `firefox build/html` (use your own browser of choice).
